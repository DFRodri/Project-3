# Project 3

Project made for the Google Challenge 2017

Pretty much everything is commented in case someone wants to dig in it and learn a few things. May not be the best for a rookie but I also made this in very little time just digging through lots of topics with the little info I had in my head from my times in University.

Have fun and stay smart! (Psst, we're all cool and strong already)
